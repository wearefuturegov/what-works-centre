        Intensive Family Preservation Programmes
      %h4
        Intensive Family Preservation Programmes (IFPPs) are interventions aimed at families in crisis, where there is an imminent risk of children entering care. They are programmes that work intensively with families to try to avoid out-of-home placement.

          How is it meant to work?
        %p
          These programmes provide a rapid response (within 24 hours of referral) and intensive (4-6 week) support including a range of services to families in crisis, tailored to the family’s needs. Typically, the programmes includes parenting training, therapeutic input for adults and/or children and practical or financial support. By intervening at times of crisis, IFPPs seek to stabilise families and help them to provide “good-enough” parenting, as well as helping to build resilience in case of future crises.
        %p
          In the US, this is referred to as the ‘Homebuilders’ model. In the UK, an IFPP model called ‘<a href="#">Option 2</a>’ has been developed specifically for families where there are serious child protection concerns related to drug or alcohol misuse.

          How does it work in practice?
        %p
          The evidence suggests that IFPPs can help families with multiple problems whose issues are not linked to abuse and neglect. They can help to avoid risk escalating and leading to removal of children. 

          There was little evidence about the mechanisms for this.

        Summary of key points
      %ul
        %li
          IFPPs appear to have a positive effect on family functioning, but overall, there was no evidence of a statistically significant effect on reducing numbers of children entering care. Desired outcomes need to be clear
        %li
          IFPPs have been used across a wider range of family types than originally intended, and they seem to work better for some groups than for others
        %li
          IFPSs seem to have a negative effect when used with low-risk families, so agencies should be cautious about which families this is right for
        %li
          Most of the studies included are from the USA and we do not know how the findings relate to the UK context
        %li
          We do not know about the costs and benefits of IFPPs 
        %li
          This is a high-intensity programme – those delivering should have relatively small caseloads
